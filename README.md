# bettingTesting

In this project, we will be downloading and analyzing betting odds to try to find opportunities for arbitrage.
The first part will be the downloader which will download the betting odds (still finding the best way of doing this) and filter it down to only the data that we need.
Next, we will be computing the data to see if any opportunities for arbitrage exist.
